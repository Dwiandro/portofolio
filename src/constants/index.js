export const ABOUT_TEXT =
  'My curiosity about technology inspired me. While many people say, "IT is too complicated," I see it as a challenge. With over a year of experience, I have mastered React, Next.js, Node.js, and databases such as MySQL, and I use these skills to create efficient yet elegant web applications. My journey started with a simple question: "How does this work?" That curiosity evolved into a passion for building solutions to real problems. I \'m passionate about all aspects of technology development, from responsive interfaces to secure back-end systems.';
